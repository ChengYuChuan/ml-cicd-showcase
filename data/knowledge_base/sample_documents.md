# Sample Knowledge Base for RAG System

## Document 1: Python Programming
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## Document 2: Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It uses statistical techniques to enable computers to identify patterns and make decisions.

## Document 3: Deep Learning
Deep learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to learn hierarchical representations of data. It has been particularly successful in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Document 4: Neural Networks
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Information flows through the network, and the connections between neurons have weights that are adjusted during training.

## Document 5: Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP techniques are used in applications like machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and text summarization.

## Document 6: Computer Vision
Computer vision is a field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It involves techniques for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding digital images or videos to produce numerical or symbolic information.

## Document 7: Data Science
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines aspects of statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain expertise.

## Document 8: Scientific Computing
Scientific computing involves the use of advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex scientific problems. It encompasses numerical analysis, computational physics, computational chemistry, and other computational approaches to scientific research.
